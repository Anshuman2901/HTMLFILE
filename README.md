# Personal Portfolio (HTML)

This is a basic personal portfolio website built using only **HTML**. It's my **first web development project**, where I’ve introduced myself, listed my hobbies, and shared my academic qualifications.

The goal of this project is to practice writing clean HTML code and understanding the structure of a webpage.
